Studious is a clean, teacher-first workspace for managing classes, assignments, and student communication—plus AI-assisted worksheet creation.
It focuses on the everyday flow of teaching: plan the week, track progress, respond to students, and ship great learning materials without extra tabs or busywork.

Studious is built for:
- Teachers who juggle multiple classes and need clarity at a glance
- Departments that want consistent, high-quality materials
- Schools that care about a calm, accessible interface
